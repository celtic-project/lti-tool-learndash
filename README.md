# lti-tool-learndash

This plugin allows LearnDash to be integrated with on-line courses using the 1EdTech Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) specification.

The LTI specifications from [1EdTech](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) provide a seamless and secure mechanism for making connections between a platform (such as an VLE/LMS) and a tool (such as a textbook on a publisher's site or a quiz engine).  This plugin enables a LearnDash installation of WordPress to be accessed as an LTI Tool.  It is built as an extension of the [LTI Tool plugin](http://www.spvsoftwareproducts.com/php/wordpress-lti/).
